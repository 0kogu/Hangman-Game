# Hangman Game

Welcome to the **Hangman Game** project! This is a colorful, interactive, and fully functional Hangman game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed to be both visually appealing and user-friendly, offering a fun way to test your word-guessing skills.


## Project Overview

The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word by selecting letters one at a time. If a guessed letter is in the word, it will appear in its correct position(s). If the letter is not in the word, the player loses one of their available tries. The game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of tries.

## Features

- **Random Words and Categories:** The game selects a random word from a predefined list, each associated with a specific category (e.g., Programming Language, Framework).
- **Interactive Keyboard:** Players can click on the on-screen keyboard to guess letters.
- **Hint Display:** The category of the word is displayed as a hint.
- **Tries Counter:** The number of tries left is displayed, and it decreases with each incorrect guess.
- **Endgame Popups:** After each game, a popup displays whether the player won or lost, along with the correct word. The player can start a new game with the "Play Again" button.
- **Responsive Design:** The game is designed to work on different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
